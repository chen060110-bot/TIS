<h1>REFLECTION</h1>
<div>
  <p>On 18 December 2025, I attended an industrial talk. From the talk, I realized that having technical knowledge alone is not enough to succeed in the field of computer science. 
     I also need soft skills such as communication, teamwork, effective planning, and project management. 
     Understanding the complete cycle of system development is essential so that I can produce high-quality systems that have a positive impact on society. </p>
  <p>In the future, I aim to strengthen my technical foundation by gaining more knowledge through group assignments, which will give me a deeper understanding of SDLC (System Development Life Cycle). 
     In addition, I will focus on project management, as it demonstrates the correct procedures in system development, including Waterfall and Agile methods. 
     Becoming more proficient in these two approaches will make it easier for me to handle computer projects when I am employed.</p>
