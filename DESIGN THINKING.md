<h1>REFLECTION</h1>
<div>
  <p>I am glad to have joined this design thinking project as I have learned a lot. 
    Through this project, I aim to gain more industry-relevant knowledge and hands-on experience that will prepare me for future employment. 
    My goal is to become a professional who can design user-friendly and innovative systems that positively impact society. 
    This project has trained me to think beyond technical knowledge and focus on users’ needs when developing systems.
  <p> By practicing empathy, problem definition, ideation, prototyping, and testing, I have learned how to approach problems both systematically and creatively. 
    To further improve my potential in the industry, I plan to enhance both my technical and soft skills, including improving my communication and learning new tools and technologies related to my field.
