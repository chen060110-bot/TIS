<h1>REFLECTION</h1>
<div>On 20 November, I attended a PPG talk. From the talk, I realized there are several areas I can improve to prepare myself for a career in ICT. 
  I should work on my soft skills by actively joining group discussions and collaborative projects. This will help me enhance my communication skills, enabling me to communicate effectively with both technical and business teams in my future workplace. 
  In addition, I should strengthen my problem-solving skills. To do this, I plan to take on more hands-on projects and real-world problem simulations, which will train me to analyze issues systematically and find efficient solutions.

<div>The talk also emphasized the growing demand for data analytics and cloud computing. I will explore these areas further by taking online courses and attending workshops, which will boost my competitiveness in the job market.
  With this plan, I will continuously reflect on my personal strengths and weaknesses and seek feedback from lecturers and peers. This way, I can improve myself and be better prepared to learn new skills.</div>
