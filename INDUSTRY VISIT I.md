<h1 align = "center"><b> INDUSTRY TALK</b></h1>
<div>On 29th October, it was an open day for UTM DIGITAL. I had been given an opportunity to visit it.Through this visit, I gained valuable insights into how digital systems and infrastructure support innovation and contribute to a smart campus environment. I was happy to have this meaningful experience because it allowed me to relate what I had learned in class to real-world digital applications. I enjoyed this visit a lot. If you want to see how's my visit day, just watch my video.</div>
