<h1>REFLECTION</h1>
<div>On 12 November, my team had a PC assembly lab. The whole process during the lab was quite enjoyable. I had the opportunity to take a closer look at the components inside a computer. We were taught the correct procedures for disassembling and assembling a PC.
As it was a team activity, teamwork was required to complete it. I think my team did a good job. It was a good activity.</div>
